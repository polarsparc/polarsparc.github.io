      <p>Introduction</p>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>There is a lot of buzz and interest in the area of <span class="hi-yellow">Zero Knowledge Proofs</span>.</p>
      <p>But, what really is a Zero Knowledge Proof ???</p>
      <p>To answer that, let us ask a question - Has anyone ever played the board game <span class="hi-blue">I Spy</span> ???</p>
      <p>The game has a board with a deck of cards - one draws a card with a picture on it and the goal is to locate that same picture
        on the board within a set time of one minute. To prevent revealing the exact location of the matching picture on the board,
        one could cover the board with a paper that has a hole big enough to reveal the matching picture and prove to an opponent.</p>
      <p>This is essense is an example of a Zero Knowledge Proof.</p>
      <p>Formally, Zero Knowledge Proof is an identification scheme, where a prover demonstrates to a verifier about some piece of
        information they posses (such as a password) without revealing any further details about that information to the verifier.</p>
      <p>In the year 1988, <span class="bold">Amos Fiat</span> and <span class="bold">Adi Shamir</span> had published a paper that
        laid the ground work for Zero Knowledge Proofs.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="gen-step-div">
      <p>The World of Passwords</p>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>In the world we live today, we identify (prove who we are) using a user-id and a password (knowledge). This is in fact an
        example of Proof of Knowledge.</p>
      <p>Let us consider an example to explain this concept further.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Bob</span> operates and runs a popular online store, called <span class="bold">bobs-store.com</span>,
        and <span class="bold">Alice</span> is one of his loyal customers. Anytime Alice wants to purchase from bobs-store.com, she
        needs to first login and prove her identity using her online credentials (user-id and password).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following is high-level flow of the password based Proof of Knowledge:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <ul id="gen-sqr-ul">
        <li><p>Alice signs-up for a bobs-store.com account by entering a user-id and a password. This is the registration process</p></li>
        <li><p>Alice's password is hashed and stored in Bob's infrastructure, to be used in future for verification purposes</p></li>
        <li><p>When Alice wants to make a purchase from bobs-store.com, she will login to the online store by providing the user-id
          and the password she used during registration</p></li>
        <li><p>The verification system on Bob's infrastructure will take Alice's password, hash it and compare it with the hashed
          password stored in Bob's infrastructure. If they match, Alice is considered verified and let in</p></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>One of the challenges with this password based approach is that information about the password has <span class="underbold">
        leaked</span> into the verifiers system albeit hashed.</p>
      <p>If for some unknown reason Bob's infrastructure is compromised by <span class="bold">Eve</span>, she will have access to the
        sensitive data (albeit hashed). Eve can then try to crack Alice's password by brute-force techniques.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>Now, for the question - Is there a better approach to the <span class="bold">Proof of Knowledge</span> scheme ???</p>
      <p>This is where the idea of Zero Knowledge Proofs come into play.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="gen-step-div">
      <p>Fiat-Shamir Interactive Algorithm</p>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following is high-level flow of the interactive Zero Knowledge Proof scheme proposed by Fiat and Shamir:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <ul id="gen-sqr-ul">
        <li><p>Alice and Bob agree on a prime number $p$ and pick a random generator $G \in \mathbb{F}_p$</p></li>
        <li><p>Alice has a secret number $s$ associated with her identity and can prove to Bob about her identity</p></li>
        <li><p>Alice computes $x = G^s \: (mod \: p)$ and sends $x$ to Bob. This is the registration process</p></li>
        <li><p>When Alice wants to transact with bobs-store.com, she will pick a random number $t \in \mathbb{F}_p$, compute $y =
          G^t \: (mod \: p)$, and sends $y$ to Bob</p></li>
        <li><p>Bob's verifier system will pick a random number $c \in \mathbb{F}_p$ and send $c$ as a challenge to Alice</p></li>
        <li><p>Alice now computes $z = t - c.s\: (mod \: p)$ and sends $z$ to Bob</p></li>
        <li><p>Bob's verifier system can now compute $G^z.x^c = G^{t - c.s}.(G^s)^c = G^t = y$</p></li>
        <li><p>Bob's verifier system can now prove the identity of Alice if Bob's computed $y$ matches the $y$ that Alice sent
          earlier</p></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>So, the question - Why is this a better approach ???</p>
      <p>The answer lies in the fact - Given $x$ there is no easy way to find $s$. This is related to the <span class="underbold">
        Discrete Logarithm Problem</span> from Modular Arithmetic.</p>
