      <p>We have been hearing a lot about <span class="hi-yellow">Blockchain</span> these days.
        So what is <span class="bold">Blockchain</span> and what is it about ???</p>
      <p>Before we answer the question <span class="bold">'what is it'</span>, let us answer the
        question <span class="bold">'what is the purpose'</span>.</p>
      <p>Let us consider the example of a car ownership to explain 'what is the purpose of
        <span class="bold">Blockchain</span> ?'.</p>
      <p>In todays world, we need a trusted central authority like the <span class="bold">Motor Vehicles</span>
        division to verify and establish ownership of the car to a person. This way one can prevent
        fraud and/or any disputes related to the ownership.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following steps establish the process of ownership through a trusted central authority (in a
        simplistic way):</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p>A Person interested in a car makes a financial commitment</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <span class="bold">Dealer</span> sells a car to a <span class="bold">Person</span> after the
            financial commitment</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Dealer and the Person submit their legal contract to a trusted central authority called the
            <span class="bold">Motor Vehicles</span>. The trusted central authority exists to prevent any
            kind of fraud or dispute amongst the Dealer and the Person</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Motor Vehicles verifies the sale, makes a record of the transaction in its system, and
            issues a physical document called the <span class="bold">Title</span> to the Person that
            establishes the ownership of the car to the Person</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following Figure-1 illustrates the above process:</p>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div id="img-outer-div">
      <img src="./images/Blockchain-1.png" class="img-cls" alt="Docker" />
      <div class="img-cap">Figure-1</div>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>In the above process, the Motor Vehicle division acting as a trusted central authority takes
        some time to process the Title and also charges some fees for the processing and maintaining of
        records in its system.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>Now, imagine a future trustless world, where everything is digitized - identities, documents, etc.
        Trust is established through consensus from a completely decentralized peer-to-peer network without
        the need for a trusted central authority.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following steps establish the process of ownership without a trusted central authority through
        consensus (in a simplistic way):</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p>Both the <span class="bold">Dealer</span> and the <span class="bold">Person</span> have unique
            digital identities. A digital identity comprises of a <span class="bold">Public</span> and a
            <span class="bold">Private</span> key and a unique id or account number. The Hash of the Public
            key forms the unique id or account number, while the Private key is used to digitally sign a
            transaction</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A Person interested in a car makes a financial commitment. This financial transaction is
            broadcast as a digitally immutable transaction (with the digital signature of the Person) on the
            peer-to-peer network where multiple <span class="bold">Participants</span> (commonly referred to
            as Nodes), including the Dealer and the Motor Vehicles, are actively listening and make a record
            of the financial transaction</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Dealer transfers the Title of ownership of the car to the Person. This ownership transaction
            is broadcast as a digitally immutable transaction (with the digital signature of the Dealer) on the
            peer-to-peer network here multiple Participants, including the Dealer and the Motor Vehicles, are
            actively listening and make a record of ownership transaction</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Since everyone in the peer-to-peer network have a copy of all the transactions, when the time
            comes to prove the ownership, everyone can independently verify and establish the ownership of
            the car to the Person through consensus</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following Figure-2 illustrates the above process:</p>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div id="img-outer-div">
      <img src="./images/Blockchain-2.png" class="img-cls" alt="Docker" />
      <div class="img-cap">Figure-2</div>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>In the above process, the Participants in the peer-to-peer network verify and establish trust
        through consensus without the need for a trusted central authority. It should be noted that it
        would be very difficult for anyone to commit fraud by trying to change any of the transactions
        in the peer-to-peer network as there are multiple copies of the transactions (one with each of
        the Participants).</p>
      <p>This is in essense the purpose of <span class="bold">Blockchain</span> at a very high level,
        to move away from centralized to decentralized model of trust, there by improving processing
        times and reducing costs.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>Now, we can answer the question 'what is <span class="bold">Blockchain</span> ?'.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Blockchain</span> is a decentralized, distributed, and secure ledger
        containing immutable blocks of transactions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following steps explain the technicalities behind <span class="bold">Blockchain</span>:</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p>As transactions are propagated through the peer-to-peer network, certain special Participants
            (Nodes) called <span class="hi-yellow">Miners</span> collect the arriving transactions into a
            <span class="hi-yellow">Block</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Once a Block is created, Miners race to solve a difficult mathematical problem. This is referred
            to as the <span class="hi-yellow">Proof-of-Work</span>, which is based on a cryptographic Hash,
            such as finding a Hash that begins with 5 zeros</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Proof-of-Work is processing intensive and exists to prevent Participants (Nodes) from
            abusing the system. The Proof-of-Work algorithm involves taking the Hash of the Hash of the
            Block of transactions plus the Hash of the previously accepted Block plus a nonce. The nonce
            is incremented iteratively to arrive at the desired outcome (such as finding a Hash that
            begins with 5 zeros)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The first Miner to solve the problem wins the competition and that Miners' Block is accepted
            for inclusion into a chain of previously processed and accepted Blocks. Hence the name
            <span class="bold">Blockchain</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The winning Miner gets to collect a <span class="hi-yellow">Transaction</span> fee as the reward
            for their processing effort</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Note that each Block refers to the previously accepted Block. The first Block (Root Block
            that has no parent Block) that initializes the system is called the
            <span class="hi-yellow">Genesis</span> Block</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Any of the Participants trying to alter the contents of a Block (trying to commit fraud) implies
            they will have to alter all the Blocks in the chain and perform very expensive Proof-of-Work
            computation on each block. Hence the reason why <span class="bold">Blockchain</span>s are
            immutable and secure</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">

    <div id="para-div">
      <p>One of the concepts related to the <span class="bold">Blockchain</span> is the
        <span class="hi-yellow">Smart Contracts</span>.</p>
      <p>A <span class="bold">Smart Contract</span> is a digital legal contract that consists of some
        data elements along with some computer code that resides in the <span class="bold">Blockchain</span>.
        When some event satisfying the terms and conditions of the contract occurs, the code self executes
        and potentially updates the <span class="bold">Blockchain</span> by generating additional transaction(s).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following steps illustrate the process of <span class="bold">Smart Contract</span> using the
        Motor Vehicles example (in a simplistic way):</p>
      <ol id="blue-ol">
        <li>
          <p>A Person interested in a car makes a financial commitment. This financial transaction is
            broadcast as a digitally immutable transaction (with the digital signature of the Person) on the
            peer-to-peer network</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Dealer transfers the Title of ownership of the car to the Person. This ownership transaction
            is broadcast as a digitally immutable transaction (with the digital signature of the Dealer) on the
            peer-to-peer network</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Motor Vehicles creates a car Registration <span class="bold">Smart Contract</span> that will
            get activated only when the Person makes a payment for the Registration. This contract transaction
            is broadcast as a digitally immutable transaction (with the digital signature of the Motor Vehicles)
            on the peer-to-peer network</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Person makes a payment to the Motor Vehicles for the car Registration. This financial transaction
            is broadcast as a digitally immutable transaction (with the digital signature of the Person) on the
            peer-to-peer network</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The event of making a payment to the Motor Vehicles for the car Registration triggers the execution
            of the <span class="bold">Smart Contract</span> (created in step 3) and makes it legal for the Person
            to use the car. Note that every Participant in the peer-to-peer independently executes the computer
            code that is associated with the <span class="bold">Smart Contract</span> since all of them have a
            copy of the contract transaction (hence the number 5 in the network)</p>
