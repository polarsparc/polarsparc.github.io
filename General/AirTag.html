      <p>So, how does an Apple AirTag really work ???</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>To get a better understanding of the inner workings, one should understand how any Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device works.
        Here is a quick start guide to <a href="https://polarsparc.github.io/General/BluetoothLE.html" target="_blank"><span class="bold">
        Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</span></a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>AirTag is essentially a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device that is powered by a coin-sized <span class="bold">CR2032</span>
        battery.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>At a high-level, the following is how an Apple AirTag integrates with the Apple ecosystem and works:</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p>An AirTag is paired with an iPhone. This pairing allows the two devices to exchange some cryptographic material</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>An AirTag then emits an undirected advertising packet every two seconds</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Every Apple device (iPhone, iPad, Mac) has a built-in Bluetooth chip that plays a dual role - as Bluetooth Classic and
            a BLE Central</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Any Apple device (iPhone, iPad, Mac) in the vicinity of an AirTag can act as a BLE Central and start scanning for the
            advertising packets (think of it like crowd-sourcing)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On receiving the advertising packet from any AirTag, the iPhone (or iPad) will determine the GPS location coordinates
            (latitude and longitude) using its GPS chip. Note that an AirTag does not have a built-in GPS</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Apple iPhone (or iPad) that processed the advertising packet and identified the GPS coordinates will transmit the
            original advertising data along with the GPS data to Apple iCloud</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When the AirTag owner opens the <span class="bold">Find My</span> app on their iPhone, it will connect to iCloud and
            some backend processing will deliver the necessary information about the AirTag to be displayed on the <span class="bold">
            Find My</span> app</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="step-div">
      <p>Peek Inside</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>Let us now take a peek inside an AirTag. There are 3 layers of boards inside - one of them is a board with the antenna. We
        will only look at the two other boards, which have the circuitry.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following is the illustration of the first board inside an AirTag:</p>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div id="img-outer-div">
      <img src="./images/airtag-2.png" class="img-cls" alt="Board One" />
      <div class="img-cap">Figure-2</div>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The section annotated in <span class="hi-green">GREEN</span> in Figure-2 above is the <span class="hi-yellow">Transceiver
        Chip</span>, which is responsible for transmitting/receiving the radio signals to/from the air and operates in the 2.4 GHz
        frequency spectrum.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The section annotated in <span class="hi-blue">BLUE</span> in Figure-2 above is the <span class="hi-yellow">Nordic BLE
        Chip</span>, which is responsible for handling the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) functionality.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The two chips together implement the layers of the BLE stack.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The AirTag-iPhone pairing process leverages the Elliptic Curve Cryptography to generate some cryptographic key along with
        a shared secret key associated with that AirTag.</p>
      <p>Every two seconds, the AirTag sends an advertising packet (broadcast) with a 2-byte Apple company identifier that is coded
        as <span class="hi-blue">0x004C</span> along with a rolling public key generated from the cryptographic key.</p>
      <p>When another crowd-sourced Apple device receives the advertising packet with the company identifier of 0x004C and the public
        key, it determines the GPS location and encrypts it with the public key and transmits both the pieces of data (payload from
        the advertising packet as well as the encrypted GPS location) to Apple iCloud.</p>
      <p>When an AirTag owner opens the <span class="bold">Find My</span> app on their iPhone, the backend server process in Apple
        infrastructure is able to figure all the rolling public keys and able to pull all the data related to the AirTag.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>Moving on, the following is the illustration of the second board inside an AirTag:</p>
    </div>

    <div id="img-outer-div">
      <img src="./images/airtag-3.png" class="img-cls" alt="Board Two" />
      <div class="img-cap">Figure-3</div>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The section annotated in <span class="hi-green">GREEN</span> in Figure-3 above is the <span class="hi-yellow">Speaker
        Coil</span>, which is used to make a ping sound when requested by the AirTag owner.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The section annotated in <span class="hi-red">RED</span> in Figure-3 above is the <span class="hi-yellow">Accelerometer
        Chip</span>, which is responsible to determine if the AirTag is moving. This is probably used to optimize how often the
        AirTag will broadcast if it has not moved.</p>
