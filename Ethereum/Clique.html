      <p>In the article <a href="https://polarsparc.github.io/Ethereum/BesuPrivateCliqueDocker.html" target="_blank">
        <span class="bold">Hyperledger Besu Private Network using Docker</span></a>, we demonstrated running a private
        <span class="bold">Ethereum</span> blockchain network using the <span class="hi-yellow">Clique</span> consensus
        algorithm.</p>
      <p>So what is <span class="bold">Clique</span> and how does the consensus protocol work ???</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p><span class="bold">Clique</span> is a type of consensus protocol referred to as the <span class="hi-yellow">Proof of
        Authority</span> (or <span class="bold">PoA</span> for short). In a <span class="bold">PoA</span> consensus algorithm,
        a set of trusted nodes known as <span class="hi-yellow">Authorities</span>, each identified by their unique identifier,
        are responsible for mining and validating the blocks in the blockchain. Each block is produced by an authority at a
        fixed interval. The responsibility of creating the next block is shared amongst the set of authorities and is done in
        a round-robin fashion.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>Assuming there are 3 authorities, identified as A, B, and C respectively, the following diagram illustrates the block
        creation process:</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="img-outer-div"> <img src="./images/Clique-1.png" class="img-cls" alt="PoA Blocks">
      <div class="img-cap">Figure-1</div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>In the <span class="bold">Clique</span> consensus protocol, the set of trusted authorities are referred to as the
        <span class="hi-yellow">Signers</span>. The process of mining a block is referred to as
        <span class="hi-yellow">Sealing</span> a block. If the next block is identified by
        <span class="hi-grey">BLOCK_NUMBER</span> and the number of signers is identified by
        <span class="hi-grey">SIGNER_COUNT</span>, and the signers are lexicographically sorted by their unique identifiers
        in a list, then the next block is sealed by the signer located at the index <span class="bold">BLOCK_NUMBER</span> %
        <span class="bold">SIGNER_COUNT</span>, where <span class="bold">%</span> is the modulus operator.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>Using our earlier example of 3 signers [A, B, C] in a sorted list, signer at index 1 (B) would seal block #1
        (1 % 3 = 1), signer at index 2 (C) would seal block #2 (2 % 3 = 2), signer at index 0 (A) would seal block #3
        (3 % 3 = 0), and so on.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>In the <span class="bold">Clique</span> consensus protocol, the signers collect and execute the transactions from the
        network into a block and update the world state. At the fixed interval referred to as the
        <span class="hi-grey">BLOCK_PERIOD</span>, the next signer in the list (identified by BLOCK_NUMBER % SIGNER_COUNT)
        calculates the hash of the block and then signs the block using its private key (sealing the block). It then broadcasts
        the sealed block to all nodes in the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>For <span class="bold">Ethereum</span> to leverage <span class="bold">Clique</span> without breaking compatibility
        with its existing clients, the field <span class="hi-green">extraData</span> from the <span class="bold">Ethereum
        </span> block header is used for signing. The first <span class="bold">32</span> bytes of the <span class="bold">
        extraData</span> field (referred to as <span class="hi-grey">EXTRA_VANITY</span>) is reserved for any vanity data
        for the signer. The last <span class="bold">65</span> bytes of the <span class="bold">extraData</span> field (referred
        to as <span class="hi-grey">EXTRA_SEAL</span>) is where the signature of the signer goes.</p>
      <p>Also, the field <span class="hi-green">difficulty</span> is set to a value of <span class="bold">2</span> if the
        block is sealed by the in-order signer (referred to as <span class="hi-grey">DIFF_INTURN</span>). Else, is set to
        a value of <span class="bold">1</span> if the block is sealed by an out-of-order signer (referred to as
        <span class="hi-grey">DIFF_NOTURN</span>).</p>
      <p>Hmm - why and when will we need an out-of-order signer ???</p>
      <p>What happens if the in-order signer is down for some reason ??? Given that a sealed block is to be generated every
        <span class="bold">BLOCK_PERIOD</span>, if the next in-turn signer is down, a block is missed after the fixed period
        and the remaining out-of-order signers will wait for a random <span class="hi-vanila">(SIGNER_COUNT * 500)</span> ms
        delay and the first out-of-order signer (after the delay) will seal the next block.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Note</span> that a block sealed with a value of <span class="bold">DIFF_INTURN</span> has a higher 
        priority than a block sealed with a <span class="bold">difficulty</span> value of <span class="bold">DIFF_NOTURN</span>.</p>
