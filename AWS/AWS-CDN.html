      <p>AWS CloudFront</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>AWS <span class="hi-yellow">CloudFront</span> is a service that speeds up distribution of a clients static or dynamic web
        content to their users. CloudFront delivers the content through a worldwide network of data centers referred to as the <span
        class="hi-vanila">Edge Locations</span>. When a user requests content that is served via CloudFront, the request is routed
        to the nearest Edge Location that provides the lowest latency.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following is the summary of the various features/capabilities of CloudFront:</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li><p>Is a <span class="hi-vanila">Content Delivery Network</span> (CDN)</p></li>
        <li><p>Is a <span class="underbold">GLOBAL</span> service</p></li>
        <li><p>Improves read performance for a global user-base since the content is cached at the edge locations</p></li>
        <li><p>There is an associated Time-to-Live (TTL) with the cached content. The default TTL is <span class="hi-red">24</span>
          hours</p></li>
        <li><p>One can associate different TTLs for different file content types</p></li>
        <li><p>An <span class="hi-vanila">Origin</span> is the source of the content, which could be an S3 Bucket or a Custom backend</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>The following are some of the features/capabilities of S3 bucket as an origin:</p>
          <ul id="blue-arw-ul">
            <li><p>For distributing static files</p></li>
            <li><p>To enhance security and ensure only CloudFront can access the S3 bucket, use CloudFront <span class="hi-vanila">
              Origin Access Control</span> in addition to setting the S3 bucket policy</p></li>
            <li><p>CloudFront can be used as a way to send data into an S3 bucket (ingress) to upload data</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The following are some of the features/capabilities of custom backend as an origin:</p>
          <ul id="blue-arw-ul">
            <li><p>Application Load Balancer (ALB) which <span class="underbold">MUST</span> be public, but the backend EC2
              Instance(s) can be private</p></li>
            <li><p>EC2 Instance(s) <span class="underbold">MUST</span> be public</p></li>
            <li><p>S3 static Website</p></li>
            <li><p>Any HTTP backend</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>If the content is not cached in a edge location, it pulls the desired content from the origin using the AWS global
          network (without going through the Internet)</p></li>
        <li><p>When a CloudFront distribution is created, it gets a public access endpoint that can be used by the users</p></li>
        <li><p>One can configure CloudFront <span class="hi-vanila">Behavior</span> to go to a specific origin based on a path
          pattern, such as, an S3 origin for image files (images/*) and to an EC2 Instance origin for other web content. A default
          origin is for all other cases</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>The following are some of the features/capabilities of CloudFront Signed URLs:</p>
          <ul id="blue-arw-ul">
            <li><p>Provides more control over access to content</p></li>

            <li><p>Can be used for individual restricted files and client that <span class="underbold">DO NOT</span> support cookies</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The following are some of the features/capabilities of CloudFront Signed Cookies:</p>
          <ul id="blue-arw-ul">
            <li><p>Used when we <span class="underbold">DO NOT</span> want to change the URLs to the restricted files</p></li>
            <li><p>Can be used for <span class="underbold">MULTIPLE</span> restricted files</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The following are some of the features/capabilities of CloudFront Geo Restriction:</p>
          <ul id="blue-arw-ul">
            <li><p>One can restrict who can access the content based on the country</p></li>
            <li><p>A country is determined using a third-party Geo-IP database</p></li>
            <li><p>The <span class="hi-vanila">Allowlist</span> is used to allow users to access the content if they are in one of
              the countries on a list of approved countries</p></li>
            <li><p>The <span class="hi-vanila">Blocklist</span> is used to prevent users to access the content if they are in one
              of the countries on a list of banned countries</p></li>
            <li><p>Useful in cases where there are Copyright Laws on accessing some content</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The following are some of the features/capabilities of CloudFront Pricing Classes:</p>
          <ul id="blue-arw-ul">
            <li><p>Cost of data out (in GB) from the edge locations varies based on the Region of the location</p></li>
            <li><p>One can reduce the number of edge locations to optimize cost</p></li>
            <li><p><span class="hi-vanila">Price Class All</span> includes all the Regions and all locations and hence the most
              expensive</p></li>
            <li><p><span class="hi-vanila">Price Class 200</span> includes most locations, but excludes locations in the Region
              that are most expensive</p></li>
            <li><p><span class="hi-vanila">Price Class 100</span> includes only locations in Regions that are least expensive</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The following are some of the features/capabilities of CloudFront Cache Invalidations:</p>
          <ul id="blue-arw-ul">
            <li><p>By default, the content from the origin is refreshed only after the cache TTL has expired</p></li>
            <li><p>In some use-cases, when we may want the users to see the latest content, in which case, one can force a full or
              partial cache refresh by performing CloudFront Invalidation</p></li>
            <li><p>One can invalidate all the files with a <span class="hi-blue">"*"</span> or only some files using a path pattern
              <span class="hi-blue">"/docs/*"</span></p></li>
