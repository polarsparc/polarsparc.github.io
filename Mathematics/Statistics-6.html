            <p>We know \(\sigma_{\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}}\) = \(\Large{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}\) =
              \(\Large{\sqrt{\frac{5^2}{15} + \frac{6.5^2}{14}}}\) \(\approx 2.164\).</p>
            <p>Also, we know z = \(\Large{\frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{\sigma_{\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}}}}\) = \(\Large{\frac{175.13 -
              178.0}{2.164}}\) \(\approx\) -1.324.</p>
            <p>For \(\alpha = 0.05\), the critical values from the z-table for -0.025 and 0.025 (since it is a two-tailed test) are
              \(z_c = -1.96\) and \(z_c = 1.96\).</p>
            <p>Since the computed standardized test statistic (z) is below the critical values \(z_c = -1.96\), we FAIL to reject
              the null hypotesis \(H_0\).</p>
            <p>Therefore, with the \(95\%\) confidence level, we conclude that the means heights of the two groups are NOT significantly
              different.</p>
            <p>One could also use the p-value to compare against the significance level \(\alpha\) to make a decision. The p-value
              corresponding to the test statistic z = -1.324 (from the z-table) is \(\approx 0.0927\). Since this is a two-tailed test,
              the p-value is 2 times the probability, which is \(\approx 0.1853\). Since the p-value is greater than \(\alpha = 0.05\),
              we FAIL to reject the null hypotesis \(H_0\).</p>

    <div id="para-div">
      <p>In reality, one would not know the standard deviation of the population. That is when the two-means t-test method is used to
        compare the means of two independent samples and determine if they came from the same population and that the population means
        are equal. The following are some of the requirements for performing the two-means t-test:</p>
      <ul id="green-sqr-ul">
        <li><p>The two samples are randomly selected</p></li>
        <li><p>The two samples are independent</p></li>
        <li><p>The two sample populations are EITHER normally distributed OR the two sample sizes \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are \(\lt 30\)</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>When the above conditions are satisfied, the following are the steps to perform the two-means t-test:</p>
      <ul id="green-sqr-ul">
        <li><p>State the significance level \(\alpha\)</p></li>
        <li><p>State the null hypothesis \(H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2\)</p></li>
        <li><p>State the alternate hypothesis \(H_a: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2\)</p></li>
        <li><p>Compute the two sample standard deviations \(s_1 = \Large{\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma{(x - \bar{x_1})^2}}{n_1 - 1}}}\) and
          \(s_2 = \Large{\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma{(x - \bar{x_2})^2}}{n_2 - 1}}}\)</p></li>
        <li><p>Compute the standard error \(s_{\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}}\) = \(\Large{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}\)</p></li>
        <li><p>Compute the t = \(\Large{\frac{(\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{s_{\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}}}}\). In many situations,
          \(\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0\). Hence, t = \(\Large{\frac{(\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2})}{s_{\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}}}}\)</p></li>
        <li><p>Compute the Degrees of Freedom d.f. = \(\Large{\frac{(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2})}{\frac{1}{n_1 -

          <th>A new software technology is developed to help data analysts reduce the time required to analaze and generate reports.
            A random sample of 24 data analysts are selected such that 12 of the data analysts are instructed to produce reports using
            the current technology, while the other 12 data analysts are instructed to produce reports using the newer technology. The
            researcher in charge of the new software technology evaluation hopes to show that the new software technology will provide
            a shorter mean completion time. The following are the mean completion times using the current technology: 300, 280, 344,
            385, 372, 360, 288, 321, 376, 290, 301, and 283 respectively. The following are the mean completion times using the new

            <p>The distribution for the new software technology is almost normal.</p>
            <p>The sample mean \(\bar{x_1}\) for the first sample is computed by adding all the mean completion times for the current
              technology and dividing by \(n_1 = 12\). That is, \(\bar{x_1} = 325.0\).</p>
            <p>The sample mean \(\bar{x_2}\) for the second sample is computed by adding all the mean completion times for the new
              software technology and dividing by \(n_2 = 12\). That is, \(\bar{x_2} = 286.0\).</p>
            <p>The sample standard deviation \(s_1 = \Large{\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma{(x - \bar{x_1})^2}}{n_1 - 1}}}\) = 39.995.</p>
            <p>The sample standard deviation \(s_2 = \Large{\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma{(x - \bar{x_2})^2}}{n_2 - 1}}}\) = 43.998.</p>
            <p>Null hypothesis: \(H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2\)</p>
            <p>Alternate hypothesis: \(H_a: \mu_1 \gt \mu_2\)</p>
            <p>In this situation, the hypothesis test is deciding if the mean completion time of current technology is greater than
              the mean completion time of new software technology. Hence, this is a right-tailed test.</p>
            <p>Given the significance level \(\alpha = 0.05\).</p>
            <p>We know \(s_{\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}}\) = \(\Large{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}\) =
              \(\Large{\sqrt{\frac{39.995^2}{12} + \frac{43.998^2}{12}}}\) \(\approx 17.165\).</p>
            <p>Also, we know t = \(\Large{\frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{s_{\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}}}}\) = \(\Large{\frac{325.0 -
              286.0}{17.165}}\) \(\approx\) 2.272.</p>
            <p>We know d.f. = \(\Large{\frac{(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2})}{\frac{1}{n_1 - 1}{[\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}]}^2 +
              \frac{1}{n_2 - 1}{[\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}]}^2}}\) \(\approx 22\)</p>
            <p>For \(\alpha = 0.05\), the critical value from the t-table for d.f. = 22 is \(t_c \approx 1.717\).</p>
            <p>Since the computed standardized test statistic (t) is beyond the critical value \(t_c\), we REJECT the null hypotesis
              \(H_0\).</p>
            <p>Therefore, at the 0.05 significance level, the sample data provides sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean
              completion times for the new software technology is lesser then the current technology.</p>
            <p>One could also use the p-value to compare against the significance level \(\alpha\) and degrees of freedom (d.f.) to
              make a decision. The p-value corresponding to the test statistic t = 2.272 (from the t-table) is \(\approx 0.0166\).
              Since the p-value is less than \(\alpha = 0.05\), we can REJECT the null hypotesis \(H_0\).</p>
