      <p>A <span class="hi-yellow">Population Proportion</span> is a fraction of the population that has certain characteristics.
        For example, if we had a population of 1000 people in a remote town and 14 of them owned a store, the population proportion
        (denoted by p) who own a store is 14 in 1000 or 14/1000.</p>

      <p>The <span class="hi-yellow">Degrees of Freedom</span> (abbreviated as d.f.) is the number of free choices left for computing
        a sample statistic such as \(\bar{x}\). As an example, consider a classroom with 20 chairs and 20 students. Each of the first
        19 students have a choice on which chair to sit on. The 20th student has no freedom of choice. The d.f. for a sample size of
        n is n - 1.</p>
