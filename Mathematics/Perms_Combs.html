              <p>This problem clearly indicates arrangement/order and hence is a Permutation problem.</p>
              <p>Let us start with 2 questions. This means we will have 2! = 2 * 1 = 2 arrangements.</p>
              <p>For 3 questions, we will have 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 arrangements. This is clearly not enough as we have 35 students in
                the class.</p>
              <p>Continuing, for 4 questions, we will have 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 arrangements. Still not enough.</p>
              <p>With 5 questions, we will have 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 arrangements. This is more than enough to cover the 35
                students.</p>
              <p>So the least number of questions we need to choose so it is different for each student is <span class="hi-yellow">5</span>.</p>
