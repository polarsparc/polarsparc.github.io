      <p>In <span class="bold"><a href="https://polarsparc.github.io/Mathematics/Statistics-4.html">Part 4</a></span> of the series,
        we introduced the point estimation of Population proportion and the population statistics using the Student's T distribution
        and the Chi-Square distribution.</p>
      <p>In this part of the series, we will venture into the world of <span class="hi-yellow">Hypothesis Testing</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section-div-3">
      <p>Basic Definitions</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>A <span class="hi-yellow">Hypothesis</span> is a statement that something is <span class="bold">TRUE</span>.</p>
      <p>A <span class="hi-yellow">Hypothesis Test</span> is the statistical process that uses the test statistic about a population
        to verify or reject the validity of the population parameter. In other words, it is a test to evaluate two mutually exclusive
        statements about the population and determines which statement the sample data supports.</p>
      <p>The following are the two mutually exclusive statements that are verified:</p>
      <ul id="green-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p>The <span class="hi-yellow">Null Hypothesis</span>, which is denoted by the symbol \(H_0\), is the initial claim that
            something is true and indicates that there is no change or difference between the population parameter (such as the mean,
            etc.) and the specified value. In other words, the null hypothesis always states that the parameter of interest is equal
            to the specified value</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <span class="hi-yellow">Alternate Hypothesis</span>, which is denoted by either the symbol \(H_a\) or \(H_1\), and
            is chosen when the null hypothesis is rejected. It indicates that there is a change or difference between the population
            parameter (such as the mean, etc.) and the specified value. In other words, the alternate hypothesis states that the
            parameter of interest is less than, greater than, or simply not equal to the specified value</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <span class="hi-yellow">Significance Level</span>, which is denoted by the symbol \(\alpha\), is related to confidence
        level and is the probability for rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true. It defines how strongly
        the sample evidence must contradict the null hypothesis before one can reject the null hypothesis for the population. As
        indicated, the significance level \(\alpha = 1 - c\), where c is the confidence level. Typical values for \(\alpha\) are
        0.05 or 0.01.</p>
      <p>A <span class="hi-yellow">p-value</span> is the probability of observing an extreme result (by random chance) from a
        statistical experiment, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In other words, the p-value is used to determine if the
        outcome of an experiment is statistically significant. A low p-value means that there is a very low likelihood that this
        outcome was as a result of luck. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence that one should reject the null
        hypothesis. In other words, if the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis.
        By convention, if a p-value is less than 0.05, it is a statistically significant observation.</p>
      <p>Note that the p-value is related to the critical value \(z_c\) (the minimum cut off point) that we learnt about in
        <span class="bold"><a href="https://polarsparc.github.io/Mathematics/Statistics-3.html">Part 3</a></span>. Critical values
        are used as a threshold for interpreting the result of a statistical test. The p-value is the probability of obtaining scores
        beyond the critical value (the minimum cut off point). The sample test statistics of the population beyond the critical value
        are called the <span class="hi-yellow">Rejection Region</span>. In other words, it is the region of the normal curve that
        relates to the minimum cut off point where the null hypothesis can be <span class="bold">REJECTED</span>.</p>
      <p>A <span class="hi-yellow">Type I Error</span> occurs when the null hypothesis is <span class="bold">REJECTED</span> when
        in fact it is <span class="bold">TRUE</span>.</p>
      <p>A <span class="hi-yellow">Type II Error</span> occurs when the null hypothesis is <span class="bold">NOT</span> rejected
        when in fact it is <span class="bold">FALSE</span>.</p>
      <p>The type I or type II error can occur because we are making a decision based on the sample statistic versus the population
        parameter.</p>

          <th>Banks often monitor the financial health of companies to which they have extended commercial loans by measuring their
            debt-to-equity ratio. If this ratio is too high, it is one indication of financial instability. In order to reduce risk,
            a large financial bank has decided to initiate a policy limiting the mean debt-to-equity ratio for its portfolio of
            commercial loans to being less than 1.5. To perform the hypothesis test, the bank randomly selects a sample of 15 of its
            commercial loan accounts. Audits of these companies result in the following debt-to-equity ratios: 1.33, 1.61, 1.45, 1.37,
            1.74, 1.29, 1.31, 1.06, 1.33, 1.22, 1.31, 1.45, 1.18, 1.13, and 1.25 respectively, which is normally distributed. The bank
            wants to assess whether the mean debt-to-equity ratio of its commercial loan portfolio is less than 1.5 using a .01 level
            of significance.
