            <p>From the Central Limit Theorem, we know \(\mu_{\bar{x}}\) = \(\mu\). That is, \(\mu_{\bar{x}}\) = 10.2</p>
            <p>Also, from the Central Limit Theorem, \(\sigma_{\bar{x}}\) = \(\Large{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}\), where n is the size
              of the sample. That is, \(\sigma_{\bar{x}}\) = \(\Large{\frac{1.4}{\sqrt{5}}}\) \(\approx{0.63}\)</p>
            <p>To find the probability the sample mean \(\bar{x}\) lies between the interval of 8 to 12 inches, we use the formula
              \(\Large{\frac{{\bar{x} - \mu}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}}\) \(\approx \Large{\frac{\bar{x} - 10.2}{0.63}}\)</p>
            <p>(A) The first interval \(\mu_{\bar{x}}\) = 8, so z = \(\Large{\frac{8 - 10.2}{0.63}}\) \(\approx{-3.49}\). The area

      <p>A <span class="hi-yellow">Point Estimate</span> is a single value estimate for a population parameter. The sample mean

        overestimate or underestimate the population parameter. From the Central Limit Theorem above, we learnt the mean \(\bar{x}\)
        of a set of sample means (of sample size n) equals the population mean \(\mu\). In other words, the sample mean \(\bar{x}\)
        is an unbiased point estimate of the population mean \(\mu\). As the sample size n increases, the variability of the sample
        mean \(\bar{x}\) decreases as the standard deviation (or standard error) \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) decreases.</p>
      <p>Using the sample mean \(\bar{x}\) as the point estimate of the population mean \(\mu\), the <span class="hi-yellow">Margin

      <p>An <span class="hi-yellow">Interval Estimate</span> is an interval range that is used to estimate a population parameter.
        To create an interval estimate, use the point estimate as the center of the interval, then add and subtract a margin of
        error from the point estimate.</p>
      <p>A <span class="hi-yellow">Confidence Level</span> denoted by c, with any value between 0 and 1 (typically 0.90, 0.95, or
        0.99) is the probability that the interval estimate contains the population parameter assuming that the estimation process
        is repeated a large number of times. A confidence level is sometimes referred to as the <span class="hi-yellow">Degree of
        Confidence</span> OR the <span class="hi-yellow">Confidence Coefficient</span>.</p>
      <p>For a confidence level of c, the <span class="hi-yellow">Critical Value</span> \(z_c\) is the number such that the area
        under the standard normal curve between \(-z_c\) and \(z_c\) equals c. The critical values are values that separate the
