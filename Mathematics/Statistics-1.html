      <p><span class="hi-yellow">Statistics</span> is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting numerical
        information from data collected from a study (domain of interest).</p>

        An example would be all the customers of a store from across the country.</p>
      <p>A portion or subset of elements from the <span class="bold">Population</span> is called a
         <span class="hi-yellow">Sample</span>. An example for a <span class="bold">Sample</span> would
         be a selection of 100 customers of a store from a particular location.</p>
      <p>There are two types of statistics - <span class="hi-yellow">Descriptive</span> and <span class="hi-yellow">Inferential</span>.</p>

      <p>The above quantitative raw data set can be organized and presented in a tablular form using
          <span class="hi-yellow">Frequency Distribution</span> (or <span class="hi-yellow">Frequency Table</span>).</p>
      <p>For a quantitative raw data set with large number of elements, it is better to organize them into a handful of intervals
        (or classes) and count the number of data elements that fall into each of the intervals (or classes).</p>
      <p>The following are the steps to create a <span class="bold">Frequency Distribution</span> table for the
          quantitative raw data set indicated above:</p>
      <ul id="green-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p>Decide on the <span class="hi-yellow">number of classes</span>. It is typically between 5 and 20 depending on the number
            of observations in the data set.</p>
          <p>As a general rule of thumb, use the <span class="hi-green">Sturge</span>'s formula as follows:</p>
          <p><span class="bold">c = 1 + 3.3 * log(n)</span></p>
          <p>where: <span class="bold">c</span> = no. of classes, <span class="bold">n</span> = no. of observations in the data set</p>
          <p>For our data set, we choose c = 6.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Determine the <span class="hi-yellow">class width</span>. The class width is defined using the following formula:</p>
          <p>class width = ceiling of [(largest value - smallest value) / no. of classes]</p>
          <p>For our data set, largest value = 44, smallest value = 7</p>
          <p>class width = ceiling of [(44 - 7) / 6 = 6.1] = 7</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Determine the <span class="hi-yellow">class limits</span>. The lower limit of the first class is the smallest value in
            the data set. The upper limit of the first class is the lower limit plus the class width minus 1. The lower limit of the
            next class is the lower limit of the previous class plus the class width.</p>
          <p>For our data set, the smallest value = 7. Hence, the lower limit of the first class is 7. The upper limit is lower limit
            which is 7 plus the class width which is 7 minus 1 equal to 13. The lower limit of the next class is the lower limit of
            the previous class which is 7 plus the class width which is 7 equals 14.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Following the above steps, the given quantitative raw data set can be organized and presented in a tablular form using the

      <p>Measures of Dispersion (or Variation)</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>As indicated earlier, the measures of central tendency provide us the center of the frequency distribution for a given data
        set. In fact, two data sets can have the same mean, but may be differently spread.</p>
      <p>Lets look at example to illustrate the point. Look at the salaries (in thousands) of employees from two companies.</p>
      <p>Company A: { 42, 38, 34, 45, 36 }, Mean: 39</p>
      <p>Company B: { 18, 77, 53, 12, 35 }, Mean: 39</p>
      <p>Both the data sets have the same mean, but the values in Company A are more closely clustered, while the values in Company
        B are spread far apart.</p>
      <p>The measures of dispersion allow us to learn about the spread of values for a given data set around the mean.</p>
      <p>There are two types of measures of dispersion - <span class="hi-yellow">Variance</span> and
          <span class="hi-yellow">Standard Deviation</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="step-div-3">
      <p>Variance</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The <span class="hi-yellow">Variance</span> is computed as the average of the squared deviations for a given data set.</p>
      <p>To find the variance for a given data set:</p>
      <ul id="green-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p>Compute the mean (\(\mu\) or \(\bar{x}\)) for the given data set</p>

          <p>Compute the deviation for each value in the given data set.</p>
          <p>If \(x_i\) is the ith value of the data set, then:</p>

          <p>For Sample: deviation = \(x_i - \bar{x}\)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Compute the square of the deviation for each value in the given data set.</p>
          <p>For Population: \({deviation_i}^2 = (X_i - \mu)^2\)</p>
          <p>For Sample: \({deviation_i}^2 = (x_i - \bar{x})^2\)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <span class="bold">Variance</span> of a population is denoted using the symbol <span class="bold">\(\sigma^2\)</span>,
             while the <span class="bold">Variance</span> of a sample is denoted using the symbol <span class="bold">\(s^2\)</span>.</p>
          <p>To find the variance, sum all the squares of the deviation for each value in the given data set and divide by the number
            of values in the given data set.</p>
          <p>For Population: \(\sigma^2\) = \(\Large{\frac{\Sigma{deviation_i^2}}{N}}\), where i = 1 to N</p>
          <p>For Sample: \(s^2\) = \(\Large{\frac{\Sigma{deviation_i^2}}{(n - 1)}}\), where i = 1 to n</p>
          <p>For a sample, we divide by (n-1) so that we obtain a better estimate of the variance. Various tests have proved that the
            estimates obtained by diving by n are smaller than the true variance.</p>
