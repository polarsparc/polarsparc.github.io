Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at University of California, Berkeley
but was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation where it remains today. In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based
MapReduce paradigm, Spark's multi-stage in-memory primitives provides performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.
By allowing user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, Spark is well-suited to machine learning algorithms.

Spark requires a cluster manager and a distributed storage system. For cluster management, Spark supports standalone (native Spark
cluster), Hadoop YARN, or Apache Mesos. For distributed storage, Spark can interface with a wide variety, including Hadoop Distributed
File System (HDFS), Cassandra, OpenStack Swift, Amazon S3, Kudu, or a custom solution can be implemented. Spark also supports a
pseudo-distributed local mode, usually used only for development or testing purposes, where distributed storage is not required and the
local file system can be used instead; in such a scenario, Spark is run on a single machine with one executor per CPU core.

Spark had in excess of 465 contributors in 2014, making it not only the most active project in the Apache Software Foundation but one
of the most active open source big data projects.
