      <p>But, before we get started, let us make sure we are all on the same page with respect to few important financial terms, such

      <p><span class="bold">Inflation</span> occurs due to various factors, such as, the government printing more money (increased
        money supply), increase in manufacturing costs, or supply-demand issues (meaning more demand and less supply).</p>
      <p>In order to curtail <span class="bold">Inflation</span>, the government typically raises the <span class="bold">Interest
        Rates</span>. This implies it becomes more expensive to borrow money to spend, which leads to consumers spending less and
        thereby forcing the prices to go lower.</p>

      <p>In early 2020, the <span class="bold">WORLD</span> got hit by <span class="underbold">COVID</span>. In addition, the
        <span class="bold">Interest Rate</span> was close to <span class="underbold">ZERO</span>. The end result - manufacturing
        came to a stand-still, creating a shortage of essential goods, while there was an abundance of money to spend. A perfect

    <div id="para-div">
      <p>In order to tame the <span class="bold">inflation</span>, the government started to raise the <span class="bold">Interest

      <p>Interestingly, when the <span class="bold">Interest Rates</span> go UP, the <span class="bold">Face Value</span> of a

        <span class="bold">Maturity</span> period. When the <span class="bold">Interest Rate</span> goes up to 2%, any new
        <span class="bold">Bond</span> issued will carry a <span class="bold">Yield</span> of 2%. That is, an investor will get $2
        at the end of each year till the <span class="bold">Maturity</span> period. This implies new investors will naturally be
        <span class="underbold">MORE</span> interested in the <span class="bold">Bond</span> with a 2% <span class="bold">Yield
        </span> versus a <span class="bold">Bond</span> with a 1% <span class="bold">Yield</span>.</p>
      <p>If an investor, who owns a <span class="bold">Bond</span> with a 1% <span class="bold">Yield</span>, falls on hard times
        and desparately needs money, they will have to sell the <span class="bold">Bond</span> at a lower <span class="bold">Face

      <p>SVB Collapse !!!</p>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>Silicon Valley Bank (SVB for short) was a regional bank in the West Coast catering to the banking needs of start-ups. At
        the end of 2019, SVB had deposits of about <span class="bold">$ 60 Billion</span>.</p>
      <p>Banks typically pay a very low <span class="bold">Interest Rate</span> on deposits, say, 0.1%. In turn, the bank uses the
        customer deposits to make loan offers to other customers who are in need of money and willing to pay a higher
        <span class="bold">Interest Rate</span>, say, 1.6%. The bank nets the profit of 1.5% from the interest earned on the loans.
        This is one of the ways the bank makes money.</p>

      <br/>
      <p>When <span class="bold">COVID</span> hit in early 2020, there was a boom in new start-ups with an abundant supply of money
        from investors. As as result, there was a sudden influx of more new deposits coming into SVB. Just to get a sense, at the
        end of 2022, SVB had deposits of about <span class="bold">$ 180 Billion</span>.</p>
      <p>SVB could not make loans offers faster to other customers, so SVB decided to invest a significant amount of those deposits
        in government <span class="bold">Bonds</span>. Remember that the <span class="bold">Interest Rates</span> were close to
        <span class="underbold">ZERO</span> till the early 2022.</p>

      </div>
      <br/>
      <p>When the government started to raise the <span class="bold">Interest Rates</span> in 2022, the start-ups began to feel the
        pain due to higher costs for goods and services. As a result, they started to tap into their deposits in SVB and began to
        make withdrawals from their deposits at SVB. In addition, the customers also wanted to take advantage of the raising
        <span class="bold">Interest Rates</span> situation and began to withdraw money from SVB for investment elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Remember that SVB had locked up its deposits in long-term government <span class="bold">Bonds</span>. In order to create
        liquidity, SVB was forced to sell some of their government <span class="bold">Bonds</span> at a loss. SVB had incurred a
        loss of about <span class="bold">$ 2 Billion</span> at the beginning of 2023.</p>

      </div>
      <br/>
      <p>When SVB came out in early Mar 2023 and indicated it needs to raise capital, it created a panic amongst customers, which
        resulted in more withdrawals, ultimately causing SVB to <span class="underbold">COLLAPSE</span> !!!</p>
